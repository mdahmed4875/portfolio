      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate full-stack web developer with a solid grasp of both
        frontend and backend technologies. I build responsive and user-friendly
        web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. On the backend,
        I work with Node.js and Express.js, and manage data with MongoDB and
        Firebase. I also have experience with Java and Data Structures &
        Algorithms (DSA), which strengthen my problem-solving skills. I use Git
        and GitHub for version control and collaboration, and I am always eager
        to learn and improve in this ever-evolving tech landscape.
